# Getting started with my project


To begin working on the project, ensure that you have Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)
installed on your system

Follow these steps in sequence:

1. Execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run npm `run build-db` to create the database.
3. Finally, use `npm run start` to launch the web application.

Next, access the page http://localhost:3000/articles/ to view all published articles. Upon database
creation, sample data such as predefined user accounts and articles will be available.

For immediate access without creating a new account, you can log in using the following credentials:

    Email: cristian.nita@email.com
    Password: test

Once logged in, you will have the possibility to create, edit, and publish articles, as well as
post comments on articles and modify the blog's name and description.
