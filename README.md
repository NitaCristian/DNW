#### Preparing for submission: TODO Remove this section ####

Make a copy of this folder
In your copy, delete the following files and folders:

* node_modules
* .git (the hidden folder with your git repository)
* database.db (your database)

Make sure that your package.json file includes all of the dependencies for your project NB. you need to use
the ```--save``` tag each time you use npm to install a dependency

#### Getting started with my project ####

Edit this section to include any settings that should be adjusted in configuration files and concise instructions for
how to access the reader and author pages once the app is running.

NB. we will ONLY run ```npm install```, ```npm run build-db```, and ```npm run start``` . We will NOT install additional
packages to run your code and will NOT run additional build scripts. Be careful with any additional node dependencies
that you use.
